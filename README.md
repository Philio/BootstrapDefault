Bootstrap Default
=================

A minimalist version of the [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) default theme based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). Intended as a parent theme for creating responsive themes for [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/).

# \*\*\* This theme is work in progress! \*\*\*

Bootstrap is included as a combination of compiled code and the less files as the theme.less requires the Bootstrap variables. This is a quick hack and will later be replaced with a submodule of the Bootstrap source.

Do not edit theme.css, this should be generated using [Less](http://lesscss.org/).
