Bootstrap Default for Piwigo
============================

A minimalist version of the [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) default theme based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
Intended as a parent theme for creating responsive themes for [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/).

## Live demo

A demo of the theme can be found here: http://bootstrapdefault.phil.si/

Note: The demo site is automatically cloned from my live site and automatically deployed from the Github master branch,
however the database has to be updated manually which can occasionally cause some images not to load. Please don't
report this as an issue.

## Installing

The theme is currently a work in progress, but is probably around 90% complete and there are only a few simple pages
left to style.

If you would like to check out the theme in it's current state, please clone this repository with the included sub
modules into your [Piwigo](http://piwigo.org/) themes directory.

## Bundled libraries

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 3.3.4 - Included as submodule
* [Selectize.js](http://brianreavis.github.io/selectize.js/) 0.12.0 - Included as sub module. Note: The bundled version
with Piwigo 2.7.x is ignored in favour of the latest build with Bootstrap styling.
